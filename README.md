## 💡 2. Problem Statement
Developers and project managers often face difficulties managing multiple GitHub repositories — navigating between pages to track issues, bookmarks, and project activities reduces productivity and increases oversight gaps.

**RepoPilot** bridges this gap by offering a **centralized dashboard** that enables users to:
- Search and explore repositories in real time  
- Track and manage issues using CRUD operations  
- Bookmark frequently used repositories  
- View project summaries and activity overviews
